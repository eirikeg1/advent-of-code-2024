# Advent of Code 2024

## Running the code
Each day is put in it's own folder, named `day_<number>`. The way to run the code depends on the
language the code is written in. The general rule is to run the program and send in 1 or 2 as
command line arguments, depending on if you want to run the first or second task of the day.

**Example for Rust programs:**
```Rust
cargo run 1
```
